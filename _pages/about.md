I am a Computer Engineering Senior at Koç University and a recipient of
[Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation for Education (AGFE)](https://www.alghurairfoundation.org/en) STEM Scholarship.

I am also a member of the Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks Laboratory (DISNET) at Koç University, where I am working on several
cool research projects.

My academic interests generally include:
* Machine Learning
* Deep learning for NLP and Computer Vision
* Data Science
* Algorithm & Data Structures
* Software Engineering Design.

Aside from academia, I'm an active competitive programmer. I continuously participate in
online rounds hosted on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/home).

# Current Directions

I am currently in the process of applying for my masters degree. My targeted research topics are:

* Developing interdisciplinary machine learning models to solve real-life problems.
* Applications Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
* Developing Algorithms and Data Structures to solve real-life problems.
