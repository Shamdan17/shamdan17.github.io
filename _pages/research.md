My current research interests can be summarized as follows:

* Developing interdisciplinary machine learning models to solve real-life problems.
* Applications Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision.
* Developing Algorithms and Data Structures to solve real-life problems.

## Current Affiliations

I am a member in the Distributed Systems and Reliable Networks Laboratory at Ko√ß University (DISNET).

## Active Projects

### Skip Graph Middleware (DISNET Lab)

Developing and implementing an enhanced version of Skip Graph data structure.

### Distributed Simulator (DISNET Lab)

Developing and implementing a simulator that can be used to deploy Distributed
Systems applications with metrics monitoring and protocol agnostic underlay.


### LightChain Proof of Validation (DISNET Lab)

A continuation to a previous project where we are adding extra features and
validing performance of LightChain.

## Previous Projects

### LightChain Proof of Concept Implementation (DISNET Lab)

We implemented a proof of concept of LightChain System. LightChain is a DHT based
blockchain with Proof of Validation as a consensus algorithm.
