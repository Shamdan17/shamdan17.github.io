## Location

Menlo Park, California, USA (Remote)

## Duration

May 2020 - August 2020

## About the Company


ViroLogic is a digital COVID-19 screening app that offers daily screenings for COVID-19 symptoms. It is also a personalized passive montoring tool. By keeping track of symptoms and monitoring vital signs on a daily basis, patients can receive an early warning as well as guidance as to how to act in case if their indicators point to a high probability of being infected. 

The company has now rebranded and is called [CareX](https://www.carex.ai/).


## My Role

I worked with a team of professors, doctors, and graduate students on developing efficient and accurate techniques to measure vitals such as breathing rate, heart rate, SpO2 (oxygen saturation), etc, using only a smartphone's camera and microphone. Our team was very diverse, containing members from many top universities including Stanford, ETH Zurich, and the Technical University of Munich.

I have managed to develop a breath rate measurement algorithm that gave state of the art results on available public datasets. I have also helped diagnose issues with and drastically improve smartphone camera footage quality to improve performance of all our current techniques.  

## What I Learned

This was a great learning experience for me since I worked with great mentors and spent a lot of one-on-one time tackling problems together. I have also got to meet many prominent people in the field of computer science including [Tom Gruber](https://tomgruber.org/), one of the co-founders of Siri and [Newton Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_Howard), former head of the MIT [Mind Machine Project](http://mindmachineproject.org/) and current director of the Oxford [Computational Neuroscience Laboratory](http://www.brainscienceresearch.org/).

I have learned a lot from my time at Virologic, including but not limited to:
* How to more efficiently research read and digest research papers
* Advanced signal processing methods
* Eulerian and wavelet transform based video magnification
* State of the art video and signal processing techniques
* Using different neural network based approaches (VAE, CNN, MLP) on signals and videos
