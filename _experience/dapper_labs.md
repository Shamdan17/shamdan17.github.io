## Location

Vancouver, Canada (Remote)

## Duration

From August 2019 to December 2019

## About the Company

Dapper Labs is a software company that focuses on blockchain-based solutions. It is well-known for creating games on blockchain. On of their most prominent applications is [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), which is a game operating on Ethereum. In December 2017, the game's popularity congested the Ethereum network, causing it to reach an all time high in number of transactions and slowing it down significantly [[src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties)].

## My Role

I was part of the network layer team of the Flow Blockchain project. We worked on the design and development of the network layer of the [Flow Blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/), which is a blockchain specifically designed to support smart contracts and to pave the way for the next generation of blockchain-based games, apps, and digital assets.

During my time at Dapper Labs, I worked with a team of very skilled interns and senior experienced developers. We gained experience in several roles during the internship. These roles included small scale testing, large scale and integrated testing, research, implementation, and architecture development.


## What I Learned

This was my first experience in a professional software engineering environment. We strictly maintained and followed the high-level coding practices.
These strict practices and coding styles introduced me to a better and more structured way of thinking and of approaching software design.

Most important topics I have gained experience in:

* Software Engineering 
* Development and debugging in multithreaded and concurrent environments
* Unit and Integrated testing
* gRPC framework
* Golang
